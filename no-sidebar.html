									<h2>Queensley Chinedu</h2>
									<p>Data Scientist | Data Analyst | Statistician</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									Having graduated with a first-class degree in statistics, I bring strong analytical skills and a knack for hypothesis testing.

									Before diving into the world of data science, I explored Java development, even publishing <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.queensley.linkmanager">an app I developed for my personal use</a>  on the Google Store. However, drawn by the potential to merge my statistical prowess with programming, I ventured into data science.
									
								</p>
								<p>
									During my internship at the Ministry of Economic Development in Akwa Ibom, I developed 
									models to cluster local government areas based on various metrics, from crime rate to standard 
									of living. Additionally, as a freelance data analyst and machine learning consultant, I've 
									enjoyed dabbling in A/B test experiments, crafting machine learning models, and diving into
									data analysis and visualization using Python libraries. Plus, I'm well-versed in SQL database 
									design and implementation, collaborating closely with clients to deliver solutions promptly and effectively.

									</p>
								<p> 
									Alongside my technical expertise, I possess excellent communication, 
									planning and time management skills, as evident in my ability to balance work life, 
									personal life and take up several volunteer roles. Furthermore, I'm highly receptive 
									to learning opportunities, always eager to expand my knowledge and skill set in pursuit of personal and professional growth.

								</p>
								<p>Looking ahead, I'm keen to further my career in data science by pursuing a PhD in the field. My ultimate goal is to leverage data science to solve pressing healthcare and agricultural challenges in Africa, making a tangible impact on people's lives and contributing to the region's sustainable development.</p>

										<h3>My Hobbies</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Besides building models, analyzing data, and writing code,
										 I find immense joy in guiding and mentoring newcomers in the tech realm. 
										 Teaching is another aspect of this journey that I wholeheartedly embrace. 
										 Currently, I proudly hold the role of Data Science Python Technical Channel Lead, 
										 a voluntary position, within <a href="https://devcareer.io/" target="_blank">DevCareer</a>, where I collaborate with two other dedicated individuals.</p>
									<p>
										Also, I double as both a Community Manager and Data Science Mentor/Guide within a small 
										community of academic scholars. Together with two talented individuals
										â€”an accomplished Bioinformatician and a skilled Backend Engineerâ€”, our goal 
										is to assist these scholars in upskilling before they embark on their postgraduate journeys.
									</p>
									<p>
										Beyond the realm of career and academia, I find solace in the realm of music. 
										Whenever an opportunity arises, you can find me lost in the melodies of my saxophone, 
										often improvising and scoring songs just for the sheer enjoyment of it ðŸ¤­. 
										And when it's time to unwind, scrolling through memes is my go-to activity, 
										offering a much-needed avenue to decompress and find some humor in the day.
									</p>

										<h3>Summary (tl;dr)</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										I hold a Bachelor's degree in Statistics with 2 years of experience in data science 
										and I enjoy mentoring and providing guidance.</p>
